# HOW TO USE

Extract the .zip file's contents into your BONEWORKS installation folder.


### Common Issues

"I can't find my BONEWORKS folder" - **If you cannot find your BONEWORKS installation folder, it is usually located under `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\BONEWORKS`** 

"The application will not run" - **If the application not running, make sure to disable your antiviruses and/or firewalls, as they may interfere with the application.** If you do not trust that the application is safe, it is fully open source and [you may view the source code here.](https://github.com/cixxytt/Boneworks-Mod-Loader)
